<h2>What?</h2>
Pagify is a simple jQuery plugin that simply replaces the contents of a div with content from other html files.

<h2>Why?</h2>
Pagify does nothing that couldn't be done before with good 'ol jQuery.<br />
It does however, provide the following advantages:<br />
<ul>
  <li><strong>Easy:</strong> Pagify can be setup with only a few lines of code. </li>
  <li><strong>Clean:</strong> Seperate your HTML files.</li>
  <li><strong>DRY:</strong> Options are used to allow for customization and need to only be changed in one place.</li>
  <li><strong>Configurable:</strong> Pagify uses CoC where it makes sense and leaves the rest up to you.</li>
</ul>
I created Pagify because I noticed that my code for single page sites was getting ugly and I was repeating myself alot.
